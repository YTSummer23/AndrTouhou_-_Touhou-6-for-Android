# AndroTouhou_-_Touhou-6-for-Android
I'm trying to port touhou 6 for android systems.
I apologize to proffesional programmer for my code.

So far only moving character is made.
And Makefile(with paths in the code) is made for linux(and probably for macOS, but i don't have it, so i don't know) system, because of '/' in a path to file.
